# SingleCell_Data_Analysis
Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is a cutting-edge technique that allows researchers to analyze the gene expression of individual cells. This method provides a deeper understanding of cellular heterogeneity and can reveal insights into developmental processes, disease mechanisms, and responses to treatments. As technology advances, scRNA-seq is becoming an essential tool in genomics research.

## The Reason 
Single-cell RNA sequencing is gaining traction and may soon be as widely used as PCR. I downloaded the 10x Genomics single-cell RNAseq data (GSE146771) from GEO, focusing on colorectal cancer, and I wanted to take this opportunity to document my insights. I hope these notes will be helpful to others as well.

Hereâ€™s a comprehensive pipeline for single-cell RNA sequencing data analysis, covering preprocessing, normalization, scaling, dimensionality reduction, clustering, and differential expression analysis:

## 1. Data Preprocessing
Load Data: Import the raw data (e.g., from 10x Genomics).
Quality Control: Filter cells based on metrics such as:
Total counts per cell
Number of detected genes per cell
Percentage of mitochondrial gene expression (to assess cell health)
Subset Data: Retain cells that meet quality control criteria.


## 2. Normalization
Normalization: Normalize the gene expression counts to account for differences in sequencing depth.
Common methods:
Log normalization: normalized_counts = log1p(raw_counts / total_counts * scale_factor)
SCRAN: Use size factors for more complex normalization.


## 3. Scaling
Scale Data: Standardize the data to have zero mean and unit variance.
This is typically done on the normalized data to ensure comparability across genes.

## 4. Linear Dimensionality Reduction
PCA (Principal Component Analysis):
Perform PCA on the scaled data to reduce dimensionality while retaining variance.
Select the number of principal components to retain based on cumulative variance explained.

## 5. Nearest Neighbor Computation
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):
Compute the nearest neighbors using the selected principal components.
This helps in clustering and visualizing the data.

## 6. Clustering
Clustering Algorithms:
Use methods like Louvain or K-means to identify clusters.
Choose parameters such as resolution for clustering (especially in methods like Louvain).

## 7. Non-linear Dimensionality Reduction
UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection) or t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding):
Visualize the clusters in two-dimensional space using UMAP or t-SNE, which are effective for visualizing high-dimensional data.

## 8. Differential Expression Analysis
Identify Differentially Expressed Genes:
Use statistical tests (e.g., Wilcoxon rank-sum test, DESeq2) to compare gene expression between clusters or conditions.
Adjust p-values for multiple testing (e.g., Benjamini-Hochberg method).

## 9. Identify Cluster Markers
Marker Genes Identification:
For each cluster, identify marker genes that are significantly upregulated compared to other clusters.
Use methods such as FindMarkers in Seurat to extract these features.

## 10. Visualization and Reporting
Visualize Results:
Create visualizations for clusters, marker genes, and differential expression results.
Common plots include heatmaps, violin plots, and feature plots.

## 11. Interpretation
Biological Interpretation:
Relate the identified clusters and marker genes to biological pathways or cell types.

## 12. Documentation
Record Findings:
Document methodologies, findings, and insights for reproducibility and further research.
This pipeline can be implemented using tools like Seurat, Scanpy, or Bioconductor, depending on your preferred R programming environment.
